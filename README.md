# Work-Day-Scheduler# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Your Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

## Client  Story

As an employee with a busy schedule
I want to add important events to a daily planner
so that I can manage my time effectively


## Acceptance Criteria

 - [x] Open the planner and create a schedule
 - [x] When planner is open the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar as I scroll down I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
- [x] The timeblocks for that day are color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- [x] Click into a timeblock and enter an event
- [x]Click the save button for that timeblock
- [x] The text for that event is saved in local storage when I refresh the page the saved events persist


The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
